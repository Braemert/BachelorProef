An asterisk (*) before a structure name indicates an exception                 
condition. When the qualification is "Alter not allowed", an exception         
condition is when INITSIZE is specified not equal to SIZE. Otherwise an        
exception condition is when INITSIZE is less than half of SIZE.

IXCH0255E A CFRM policy structure specification has too large a                
difference between the INITSIZE and SIZE values.                               

  Explanation:  A specification of INITSIZE in the active or pending           
	CFRM policy indicates an initial structure size that is too small          
    for the maximum structure size (as determined by the SIZE                  
    specification). Either a structure has an initial size specified as        
    less than half the maximum size, or a structure whose users do not         
    allow structure alter has an initial size specified different than         
    the maximum size.                                                          

    When allocating the structure initially, whether INITSIZE is               
   specified or not, the system attempts to build all control                 
   structures that will be required to support the maximum size of the        
   structure. These control structures are built in the control storage       
   allocation of the structure. For structures whose users do not allow       
   structure alter, the control storage allocated to accommodate larger       
   sizes is wasted. An INITSIZE value substantially smaller than the          
   SIZE value might cause the following:                                      

     - It might be impossible to allocate a structure at a size of            
       INITSIZE, because the amount of control storage required to            
       support the SIZE value might actually be larger than INITSIZE.          

     - If the allocation succeeds, it might result in a structure with        
       a proportionally large amount of its storage allotted to               
       structure controls, leaving too few structure objects to be            
       exploited usefully by the associated application.                      

 System Action:  The system continues processing.                             

 Operator Response:  N/A                                                      

 System Programmer Response:  IBM suggests that the INITSIZE and SIZE         
   specification for structures be determined by the CfSizer (Coupling        
   Facility Structure Sizer) tool:                                            
                                                                               
      http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/cfsizer                                    

   Use the CfSizer tool to determine the INITSIZE and SIZE parameters         
   for structures with an exception condition. Update the CFRM policy         
   (or policies) with the new parameters. The new parameters should not       
   have an INITSIZE value for a structure less than half the SIZE value       
   for that structure. If alter is not allowed by users of a structure,       
   INITSIZE should not be specified for that structure. Start an              
   updated policy with the following system command:                          

      SETXCF START,POLICY,TYPE=CFRM,POLNAME=polname                            

    The policy changes will become pending and affect only future              
    structure allocations, not currently allocated structures. REBUILD          
    or REALLOCATE can be used to activate the pending changes for              
    currently allocated structures. For example, a REALLOCATE process          
    can be started with the following system command:                          

       SETXCF START,REALLOCATE                                                 

   Problem Determination:  See IXCH0923I in the message buffer that             
    identifies the coupling facility structures with an exception              
    condition.                                                                 

    The problem may have occurred because a CFRM policy structure SIZE         
    value was adjusted without also adjusting the INITSIZE value (or           
    vice versa).                                                                

    The following system command can be used to determine the name of          
    the active or pending CFRM policy:                                         

       DISPLAY XCF,POLICY,TYPE=CFRM

  Automation:  N/A                                                             

  Check Reason:  Too large a difference between INITSIZE and SIZE may          
    waste coupling facility space or prevent structure allocation.
